                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>App development has been something that really piqued my interest, especially in the User - Interface side. While this is relatively new to me, I was always interested in technology, mainly towards the designing side. I picked this up as a hobby in around September of 2019 this year after watching multiple videos of app design and development. This picture really showcases this technology-geek side of me that is very engrossed in how a lot of technology such as apps and games work..</p>
